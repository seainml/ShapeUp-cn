# ShapeUp-cn
Chinese translation and notes for the book [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) from the Basecamp team.

## Roadmap 
This is a personal project which will take approximately six weeks to complete. The following is the roadmap.
  - week0: Publish this project to GitBook and begin translating content that is not included in the main chapters.
  - week1-4: About 4 chapters a week for the translation
  - week5: Unified processing of layout issues including images

## Acknowledgments
There is already [a translation copy](https://github.com/fenbox/shapeup) by @fenbox before I start my work.
