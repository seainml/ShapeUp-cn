# ShapeUp-cn
Chinese translation and notes for the book [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) from the Basecamp team.

## Roadmap 
This is a personal project which will take approximately six weeks to complete. The following is the roadmap:
  - week 0: Publish this project to GitBook and begin translating content that is not included in the main chapters.
  - week1-4: About 4 chapters per week for the translation
  - week 5: Unified processing of layout issues including images

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the previous translation [copy](https://github.com/fenbox/shapeup) by @fenbox, which will be helpful in this project. 
Thanks to @fenbox's work, those images collected by him will be used directly in this project(pending permission).
